		    I would like to work as a Software Developer or Software Engineer upon graduating from college. I want to work in a field related to Big Data and Cloud Computing. Another field that really interests me is Data Science. Upon completing my internship with EMC I have gained knowledge on what a Data scientist does and would like to further explore this field.

		    My goal is to be able to financially support myself and my family in addition to giving back to the community. I think it is really important to give back to those who may be less fortunate because kindness and respect are earned not given.
